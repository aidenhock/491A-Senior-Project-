We reconviened as a group to discuss and develop our individual product proposals.

We had a bug where the whole git was wiped so we spent time working to restore our files.

Diego notified us he could not participate in today's session as he is still working on his air monitoring product proposal
and needs further discussion with air manager.

Noah and Jacob are MIA, edit: Noah joined!

we decided because of lack of team participation that we would reconveince once again later tonight at 8:30
