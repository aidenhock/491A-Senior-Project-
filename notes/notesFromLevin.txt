song analysis-- like pandora, api song meta-data
	Tempo Adjustment: like beats per minute, key, metrenome dont act (tempo: BPM (italian notation 	for bpm ex. 	el dente), display metronome 

collaboration and networking: centralizing a very user friendly way to collaborate with other musicians. 

Sheet Music and Tabs: don't do it
audio visualizer: great idea 
musive theory resources: good idea, but stay utilitarian mostly, minigames are low priority (pitch mini game ask levin for advice with getting perfect pitch).
community forums and discussions: make it as apple as possible, community help guide section? 


recording and mixing tools: good idea as long as its basic (record dry and able to , only need volume mixing)

	--have arranging clips on timeline, and changing volume on clips a feature, 

video integration for profile resume: good, upload 
event calendar: good, tie to venue and musician profile


Legal and Licensing Information: really good idea for people who can't go to school 
Collaborative Workspace: musicians are tech illiterate, AUDIO TRELLO FOR ILLITERATE PEOPLE WITH CATERACTS
Project Dashboard: works like github 


Music Uploader: include band camp and spotify, maybe distrokid?, --apis=> 

Portfolio: tied to profile, demo real/short video
messaging between users:
bingo bullitin board page: great idea, job board 
Venue Owner Profile (should just be a user type): Has a calendar view for gigs, Manage applicants


half messaging/half file sharing directory.


if you doing ANY sound editing, keep it basic. Musicians are picky. No frequency editing, filters or bass treble, volume editing, and moving clips around on a timeline is good. 

careful of sheet music and advance sound editing

TRAGET AUDIENCE: People who are KIND OF familiar with music.
